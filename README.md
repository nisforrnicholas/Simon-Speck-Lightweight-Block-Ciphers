# Simon-Speck-Lightweight-Block-Ciphers
This repository contains my implementations of the Simon and Speck lightweight block ciphers developed by the National Security Agency (NSA).

My implementation of a Key Solver using Differential Fault Analysis Method for the Simon Cipher is also included.

More information about the ciphers can be found in the 'Supporting Document' PDF file.
